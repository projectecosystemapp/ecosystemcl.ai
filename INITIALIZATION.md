# ECOSYSTEMCL.AI Initialization Complete 🎉

Your ECOSYSTEMCL.AI monorepo has been successfully initialized!

## ✅ What was done:

1. **Dependencies Installed**: All packages and their dependencies have been installed via pnpm
2. **TypeScript Configuration**: Fixed TypeScript errors in the web package
3. **Vite Configuration**: Added necessary Vite dependencies for the testing framework
4. **CLI Verification**: The ecosystem CLI is working (version 1.0.0)

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands:

### Run the web app locally:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Use the CLI to create AI agent tasks:
```bash
./packages/cli/bin/ecosystemcli plan "Your task description here"
```

### Run tests:
```bash
pnpm test
```

### Type check all packages:
```bash
pnpm type-check
```

## 🔧 Next Steps:

1. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys
   - You'll need:
     - AWS credentials (for cloud deployment)
     - AI model API keys (OpenAI/Anthropic)
     - Supabase or database credentials

2. **Set up AWS (for cloud features)**:
   - Configure AWS credentials: `aws configure`
   - Deploy infrastructure: Follow the amplify deployment guide

3. **Start Building**:
   - Web interface is at `packages/web`
   - CLI tool is at `packages/cli`
   - Worker/backend logic is at `packages/worker`

## 📚 Resources:

- Main documentation: `README.md`
- Architecture overview: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Production guide: `PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md`
- Agent definitions: `packages/cli/agents/*.yaml`

## ⚠️ Known Issues:

- Some peer dependency warnings from AWS Amplify packages (React 19 vs 18) - these can be safely ignored
- CSS inline style warnings in the dashboard - cosmetic only

Happy coding with your AI agents! 🤖
