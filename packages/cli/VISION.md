# FORGE: Project Vision

## Mission Statement

To provide engineering teams with a powerful, reliable, and transparent orchestration layer for autonomous AI agents, transforming software development from a series of manual tasks into a supervised, automated workflow. FORGE is the command center that makes multi-agent development a practical reality.

## Target Audience

- **High-Performance Engineering Teams**: Teams looking to accelerate their development cycles by automating code reviews, quality checks, and routine feature development.

- **DevOps & Platform Engineers**: Professionals responsible for maintaining code quality, security, and architectural consistency across large codebases.

- **Senior Developers & Tech Leads**: Individuals who want to leverage AI as a force multiplier, allowing them to focus on high-level architecture while agents handle the implementation details.

## Core Principles

### Autonomy with Oversight
The system defaults to full autonomy but provides a comprehensive, real-time audit trail for every action. The human is the project manager, not the micromanager.

### Git-Native
All operations are built on Git primitives (branches, worktrees, merges, PRs). There is no proprietary state management. The git log is the record of truth.

### Extensibility First
The core value of FORGE is its ability to coordinate *your* agents. The agent configuration system must remain simple, powerful, and easy to extend.

### Resilience is Non-Negotiable
Complex tasks will fail. The system is designed from the ground up to handle timeouts and errors through checkpointing and resumability.

## Feature Roadmap

### v1.0 (Current Scope)
- ✅ Core CLI with `audit`, `task`, `migrate`, and `sessions` commands
- ✅ Local agent execution via the AgentDispatcher
- ✅ Support for YAML-based agent configuration
- ✅ Git worktree-based parallelization
- ✅ Session checkpointing and resumption
- ✅ Real-time structured logging

### v1.1 (Next Steps)
- **`forge ui`**: A terminal-based user interface (TUI) for a rich, interactive dashboard to view running agents, their logs, and the overall progress of a pipeline.
- **Official Plugin System**: A formal system for adding new tools (e.g., `run_security_scanner`) and result parsers to the orchestrator.
- **Cost & Token Tracking**: Add logging to track token usage per agent and per task to better understand the operational cost.

### v1.2 (Enhanced Features)
- **Agent Performance Metrics**: Track success rates, execution times, and resource usage per agent
- **Conditional Workflows**: Allow agents to trigger other agents based on their findings
- **Multi-Repository Support**: Coordinate agents across multiple related repositories
- **Custom Tool Integration**: SDK for adding project-specific tools to agent capabilities

### v2.0 (Future Vision)
- **Remote Execution Engine**: Ability to configure FORGE to dispatch agents to run on dedicated cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run) for more powerful, long-running tasks.
- **Agent Marketplace**: A community repository where users can share and download pre-configured agent YAML files for various languages and frameworks (e.g., `rust-code-reviewer`, `django-security-auditor`).
- **Team Collaboration Features**: Multiple developers can monitor and control the same FORGE pipeline
- **Enterprise Features**: RBAC, audit logs, compliance reporting

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Average task completion rate > 90%
- Session recovery success rate > 95%
- Agent parallel execution efficiency > 3x single-agent throughput
- Mean time to recovery from failure < 30 seconds

### User Success Metrics
- Time saved per developer per week: > 10 hours
- Critical bugs caught by agents before production: > 80%
- Feature implementation velocity increase: > 2x
- Developer satisfaction with agent autonomy: > 4.5/5

## Competitive Landscape

FORGE differentiates itself through:
1. **True Parallelization**: Unlike sequential AI coding assistants, FORGE runs multiple agents simultaneously
2. **Git-Native Design**: No proprietary databases or state management systems
3. **Observable by Default**: Full structured logging for every agent action
4. **Resilience-First**: Built for long-running, complex tasks with checkpointing
5. **Open & Extensible**: YAML-based configuration allows infinite customization

## Long-Term Vision

FORGE will become the industry standard for orchestrating AI development teams. Just as CI/CD transformed how we ship code, FORGE will transform how we write it. In five years, we envision:

- Every major engineering team using FORGE or FORGE-inspired orchestrators
- A thriving ecosystem of specialized agents for every framework and language
- AI agents becoming trusted team members, not just tools
- Development velocity increasing 10x while maintaining or improving code quality
- The emergence of "AI DevOps Engineer" as a standard role

## Call to Action

The future of software development is autonomous, parallel, and observable. FORGE is the infrastructure that makes this future possible today.
